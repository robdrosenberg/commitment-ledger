# Commitment Ledger

This is the application I'll be creating for my Capstone project with Actualize.

It's core focus to help you protect your commitments. It does this by helping you track when, who and what you've committed to.

This will help you fulfill your commitments and mangage your time so you are less likely to break promises you have with people or yourself!

Feel free to reach out if you have questions, concerns or advice!
