# Commitment Ledger

This is the application I'll be creating for my Capstone project with Actualize.

It's core focus is to help you protect your commitments. It does this by helping you track when, who and what you've committed to.

Hopefully this application will help you fulfill your commitments and mangage your time so you are less likely to break promises you have with people or yourself! If it's purpose is acomplished you should have better relationships personally and professionaly and be less stressed due to being over committed!

Feel free to reach out if you have questions, concerns or advice!
